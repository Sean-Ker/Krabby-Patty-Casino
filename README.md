## Structure

The structure of the project consists of 4 important files:
1. ```game_combinatorics.py```- a utility file full of useful statistical functions.
2. ```grid_world.py```: The object oriented programming behind the program.
3. ```game.py```: The main game to run. See instructions below.
4. ```simulator.py```: A simulator that reassures the mathematics from the report.

## Usage on Windows
1. Please make sure that [```python 3.X```](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [```pip```](www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/) are installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.

4. run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. run ```python game.py -h``` for further instructions. For example: ```python game.py --x 5 --y 5 --l 2``` or ```python game.py --x 4 --y 3 --l 1```.
